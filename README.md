This is an automated poultry monitoring system, APMS for short.
This system uses sensors and software to track various parameters such as temperature, water levels, feed levels, security, and sound of the poultry.

The temperature monitoring aspect of this system ensures that the poultry house remains within a suitable range for the birds' growth and survival. The system continually measures and records the temperature within the poultry house, and alerts the farmer in case of any sudden or gradual changes in temperature that could harm the birds.

Water level monitoring is crucial for the proper hydration of the poultry. This system keeps track of the water levels in the water containers, and alerts the farmer when the water levels are too low. This ensures that the birds always have access to clean drinking water.

Feed level monitoring ensures that the birds are getting enough food to sustain their growth and health. The system tracks the feed levels in the feeders and notifies the farmer when the levels are low. This feature helps to prevent malnourishment or overfeeding, which can harm the birds.

The security aspect of the system involves monitoring the poultry house for unauthorized access or intruders. The system uses cameras and sensors to detect any unusual activity and immediately alerts the farmer. This helps to prevent theft, vandalism, or any other forms of harm to the birds.
